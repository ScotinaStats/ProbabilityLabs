## Introduction

The goals of today's lab are to:

- simulate data from several of the named probability distributions covered in class.

- calculate probabilities involving discrete random variables using R's built-in functions for the *cumulative distribution function* (CDF) and the *probability mass function* (PMF).

- visualize probability distributions using one of R's many incredible data visualization packages.

### Built-in R Functions

There are ways to simulate data from some of the discrete probability distributions we've discussed using `sample()`. We could also write a **function** based on the PMF of a distribution and sample data using that function (more on this in a future lab!). 

Because R is a *statistical computing program* first and foremost, it actually contains built-in functions for generating data,  computing probabilities and quantiles, and computing cumulative distributions for each of the *named* discrete probability distributions we've discussed. Each type of random variable can be evaluated in one of several ways by the **Fantastic Four Functions**:

- `r` -- random number generator; essentially a more specific version of `sample()`

- `d` -- the probability mass function (PMF) for **discrete** RVs
    - Calculates probabilities of the form $P(Y=y)$. 

- `p` -- the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
    - Calculates probabilities of the form $P(Y\leq y)$. 
    
- `q` -- the **quantile** function
    - Computes $y$ such that $P(Y\leq y)=q$.

Each of these letters is followed by a named probability distribution; for example, the `r` function has several versions: `rbinom()`, `rgeom()`, `rpois()`, etc., where each of these functions has different arguments depending on the parameters in the respective probability distribution.

## Binomial Distribution

Suppose $Y\sim Binomial(n,p)$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ is the success probability. Then the Fantastic Four Functions look like this:

- `rbinom(N, n, p)` -- generates a **vector** of $N$ random numbers from the $Binomial(n,p)$ distribution

- `dbinom(y, n, p)` -- calculates $P(Y=y)$ for $Y\sim Binomial(n,p)$

- `pbinom(y, n, p)` -- calculates $P(Y\leq y)$ for $Y\sim Binomial(n,p)$

- `qbinom(q, n, p)` -- computes $y$ such that $P(Y\leq y)=q$ for $Y\sim Binomial(n,p)$, where $0\leq q\leq 1$. 

###

### Dataviz

Recall from class the *widely-known fact* that 70% of customers at PiÃ©chart Emporium qualify for a discount. Assume that we observe 20 customers walk PiÃ©chart Emporium during one afternoon (they run out of supplies after 20 customers), and that each customer is *independent* and not likely to influence the discount chances for another customer. 

- We can treat the **number of customers who qualify for a discount**, $Y$, as a $Binomial(20,p=0.7)$ random variable. 

Using `rbinom()`, let's generate 100 observations from the $Binomial(20,p=0.7)$. This could represent 100 different days where PiÃ©chart Emporium was running the discount, for 20 customers each day:

```{r, prepare-y_binom}
set.seed(338) # Use for reproducibility
Y = rbinom(100, 20, 0.7)
```
```{r, y_binom, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
set.seed(338) # Use for reproducibility
Y = rbinom(100, 20, 0.7)
Y
```

We can visualize this set of observations with a **histogram**, using either `gf_histogram()` from the `mosaic` package, or by using the `ggplot2` framework:

```{r, binom-graph, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-y_binom"}
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)

# mosaic
gf_histogram( ~ Y) + 
  labs(x = "y")
```

### Exercise 1 

If $Y\sim Binomial(20, 0.7)$, then what is $E(Y)$? Find $E(Y)$ by hand, but also use R to *estimate* $E(Y)$ and $E(Y^2)$. 

```{r, ex1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex1-solution}
Y = rbinom(1000, 20, 0.7)
mean(Y)
mean(Y^2)
```

### Probability Function

**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**

If $Y\sim Binomial(n,p)$, then it's probability function is given by $$P(Y=y)=\binom{n}{y}p^{y}(1-p)^{n-y}\ y = 0,1,2,\dots,n.$$ While we *could* use this formula to find any probabilities associated with binomial random variables, this can get to be quite cumbersome. 

### Exercise 2 

If $Y\sim Binomial(20, 0.7)$ represents the distribution of customers who qualify for the PiÃ©chart Emporium discount out of groups of 20, find the probability that *more than 10*, but *no more than 14* customers qualify for the discount (in other words, $P(10<Y\leq 14)$. Use the PMF directly!

[**Hint**: We can evaluate binomial coefficients in R with `choose(n, y)`.]

```{r, ex2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex2-solution}
choose(20, 11)*0.7^11*(1-0.7)^(20-11) + 
  choose(20, 12)*0.7^12*(1-0.7)^(20-12) +
  choose(20, 13)*0.7^13*(1-0.7)^(20-13) +
  choose(20, 14)*0.7^14*(1-0.7)^(20-14) 
```

###

While I'm sure it was a *blast* to calculate that out by hand, we can use `dbinom()` to streamline this calculation quite a bit! 

Because $P(10<Y\leq 14)$ actually represents the probability of a **union of mutually exclusive events** (e.g., we can't simultaneously observe exactly 11 and 12 people qualify for the discount), we can simply add up the individual probabilities:

```{r, dbinom1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
dbinom(11, 20, 0.7) + dbinom(12, 20, 0.7) + dbinom(13, 20, 0.7) + dbinom(14, 20, 0.7)
```

Equivalently, we can apply the vector `11:14` to a single `dbinom()`, and add up the resulting vector:

```{r, dbinom2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
dbinom(11:14, 20, 0.7)

sum(dbinom(11:14, 20, 0.7))
```

We could also *simulate* this using the `Y` vector that we created earlier:

```{r, dbinom3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-y_binom"}
mean(Y %in% 11:14)
```


### Exercise 3

PiÃ©chart Emporium upper management gets angry if more than 17 customers qualify for the discount on a given day. Find the probability that more than 17 customers qualify for the discount.

```{r, ex3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex3-solution}
dbinom(18, 20, 0.7) + dbinom(19, 20, 0.7) + dbinom(20, 20, 0.7)

#OR

1 - pbinom(17, 20, 0.7)
```

###

If $P(Y=11)=0.0654$, we can work *backwards* with `qbinom()` to find the value of $y$:

```{r, qbinom, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
qbinom(0.0654, 20, 0.7)
```

###

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**

In the previous problem, we had to calculate $P(Y> 17)$ to find the probability that upper management gets angry. Note that $$P(Y>17)=1-P(Y\leq 17).$$ While it could get tedious to use `dbinom()` over and over to calculate $P(Y\leq 17)$, we could also use `pbinom()` because $P(Y\leq y)$ is the **cumulative distribution function** (CDF).

```{r, pbinom1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
pbinom(17, 20, 0.7) # P(Y <= y)

1 - pbinom(17, 20, 0.7) # P(Y > y)
```

### Exercise 4

The *Newton-Pepys Problem* from class actually involves the binomial distribution - we are counting the total number of 6s out of 6 (or 12, or 18, etc.) dice tosses! Let $Y$ denote the total number of 6s out of 12 dice rolls. Using `dbinom()` and/or `pbinom()`, find the probability of rolling at least two 6s. 

```{r, ex4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex4-solution}
1 - pbinom(1, 12, 1/6)
```

## Geometric Distribution

Suppose $Y\sim Geometric(p)$, where $p$ is the success probability. Then the Fantastic Four Functions look like this:

- `rgeom(N, p)` -- generates a **vector** of $N$ random numbers from the $Geometric(p)$ distribution

- `dgeom(y, p)` -- calculates $P(Y=y)$ for $Y\sim Geometric(p)$

- `pgeom(y, p)` -- calculates $P(Y\leq y)$ for $Y\sim Geometric(p)$

- `qgeom(q, p)` -- computes $y$ such that $P(Y\leq y)=q$ for $Y\sim Geometric(p)$, where $0\leq q\leq 1$. 

The geometric distribution is related to the binomial distribution in that they each involve a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$. The difference is that the geometric distribution models the **trial on which the first success occurs**, rather than the *number of successes out of n trials*.

###

### Dataviz

In a geometric distribution, the main parameter of interest is the success probability, $p$. This is because there is not a fixed number of trials, $n$ - we could keep repeating Bernoulli trials over and over again until we hit that first success, if $p$ is small enough!

Here's our setting for working with the geometric distribution: Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown had a *free throw percentage* of 76% last season. Assuming that each free throw is independent (a questionable assumption if you believe in the [hot hand](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/momentum-isnt-magic-vindicating-the-hot-hand-with-the-mathematics-of-streaks/), but let's go with it) with constant probability of *missing a free throw* of 0.24, we can model the distribution of the number of free throw on which Jaylen Brown *first misses*, $Y$, with a $Geometric(0.24)$ distribution.

###

Using `rgeom()`, let's simulate a set of 100 different free throw sequences for Jaylen Brown:

```{r, prepare-y_geom}
set.seed(338)
Y = rgeom(100, 0.24) + 1
```
```{r, rgeom, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
set.seed(338)
Y = rgeom(100, 0.24) + 1
Y
```

> ðŸš¨**NOTE**ðŸš¨: The geometric distribution functions in R are used to model the number of trials *until* the first success occurs, not the trial *on which the first success occurs*. To stay consistent with the WMS textbook, we'll add 1 to each element from `rgeom()` to account for this. 

### Exercise 5

Using tools similar to *Exercise 1*, plot the simulated distribution of $Y$. Use `mean()` to find the simulated $E(Y)$.

```{r, ex5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex5-solution}
set.seed(338)
Y = rgeom(100, 0.24) + 1
gf_histogram( ~ Y)
```

### Probabilities

**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**

Similar to `dbinom()`, we can use `dgeom()` to find probabilities of the form $P(Y=y)$. If $Y\sim Geometric(p)$, then $$P(Y=y)=p(1-p)^{y-1}, y=1,2,\dots$$ While we can definitely calculate probabilities by hand with this formula, things can quickly get unwieldy since $y$ isn't capped by a fixed number of trials, $n$. For instance, finding $P(Y=10)$ is fine, but $P(Y >10)$ would take a bit more work.

Because R's geometric distribution functions model the number of trials *until* the first success, our `dgeom()` (and `pgeom()`) syntax will be (this is detailed on page 118 of WMS):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dgeom(y-1, p)
```

### Exercise 6

Find the probability that Jaylen Brown begins the new 2021-2022 NBA season on a hot streak and doesn't miss a free throw until his 10th attempt. That is, find $P(Y=10)$. 

```{r, ex6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex6-solution}
dgeom(10-1, 0.24)
```

## Poisson Distribution

Suppose $Y\sim Poisson(\lambda)$. Then the Fantastic Four Functions look like this:

- `rpois(N,lambdap)` -- generates a **vector** of $N$ random numbers from the $Poisson(\lambda)$ distribution

- `dpois(y, lambda)` -- calculates $P(Y=y)$ for $Y\sim Poisson(\lambda)$

- `ppois(y, lambda)` -- calculates $P(Y\leq y)$ for $Y\sim Poisson(\lambda))$

- `qpois(q, lambda)` -- computes $y$ such that $P(Y\leq y)=q$ for $Y\sim Poisson(\lambda)$, where $0\leq q\leq 1$. 

The PMF for the $Poisson(\lambda)$ distribution is given by $$P(Y=y)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{y}}{y!}.$$ In R...

- $e^{-\lambda}$ can be found with `exp(lambda)` (replace `lambda` with a number).

- $y!$ can be found with `factorial(y)`.

###

Let's work through a few exercises that involve the Poisson distribution and the *Fantastic Four Functions*, under the following setting:

> The PiÃ©chart Emporium call center is a fairly lively place. Apparently, people aren't thrilled that only 20 customers can visit the store each day! Based on historical records, the PiÃ©chart Emporium call center averages two calls per minute. 

> We'll use the Poisson distribution to model the number of calls per minute ($Y$). That is, let $Y\sim Poisson(\lambda = 2)$. 

Make use of the help pages if you get stuck! `?rpois`, `?ppois`, `?dpois`

### Exercise 7

Simulate 10,000 observations from the $Poisson(2)$ distribution. These observations each represent the number of calls to the PiÃ©chart Emporium call center in different one-minute intervals. Construct a histogram of this distribution. 

```{r, ex7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex7-solution}
Y = rpois(10000, 2)
gf_histogram( ~ Y)
```

### Exercise 8

Find the probability that zero calls are received in a one-minute period. 

```{r, ex8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex8-solution}
dpois(0, 2)
```

### Exercise 9

Find the probability that more than two calls are received in a one-minute period. 

```{r, ex9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex9-solution}
1 - ppois(2, 2)

# OR SIMULATE

Y = rpois(10000, 2)
mean(Y > 2)
```

### Exercise 10

Estimate the *maximum* number of calls received in any one-minute period. Use your 10,000 simulated Poisson observations from earlier!

```{r, ex10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex10-solution}
Y = rpois(10000, 2)
max(Y)
```

## Conclusion

While we simulated data from the binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions, R also has built-in functions for the **negative binomial** and **hypergeometric** distributions, in addition to a bunch of *continuous distributions* that we haven't even looked at yet. 

Stay tuned!
