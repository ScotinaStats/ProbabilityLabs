## Introduction

In this lab, we'll continue with our work on using simulation techniques in R to *estimate* probabilities. This time, we will simulate *well-known* (dare I say, **famous** ðŸ¤©) probability problems.

To recap, the two main simulation functions we've looked at so far are **base R's** `sample()` and `replicate()`:

### `sample()` 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
```

- `x` is the **vector** of all *objects* from which we are sampling. 

- `size` is the number of objects we would like to select from `x`. 

- `replace` is a `TRUE` or `FALSE` value indicating whether sampling be done *with replacement*.
    
- `prob` is a *vector* of **probability weights** for each element in your vector, `x`. 

### `replicate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
replicate(n, expr)
```

- `n` is the number of times I want to repeat the single trial. I usually set this to 10,000. 

- `expr` is the *block of code* we wish to repeat `n` times. 

I usually like to surround the `expr` in brackets, `{...}` - note that this is required if the block of code in `expr` includes more than one line. 

### The `replicate()` Workflow

As a reminder, I recommend you follow this workflow from [Speegle and Clair (2021)](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/preface.html) when using `replicate()` to estimate probabilities:

1. Write code that performs the experiment a single time.

    ```{r, coin_toss, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
    coin_tosses = sample(c("H", "T"), size = 20, replace = TRUE)
    coin_tosses
    sum(coin_tosses == "H") >= 12
    ```

2. Replicate the experiment a small number of times and **check** the results:

    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    replicate(100, {
      EXPERIMENT GOES HERE
      ...
    })
    ```
    
3. Replicate the experiment a large number of times and **store** the results:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    event = replicate(10000, {
      EXPERIMENT GOES HERE
      ...
    })
    ```

4. Estimate the probability with `mean(event)`. Note that `event` will *always* be a **logical vector**, so you'd be taking the mean of a bunch of 1s and 0s. 

## Birthday Problem

First, we'll review some simulation techniques in R by walking through the [Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem):

> Suppose that there is a room with *n* people, and each has an equally-likely chance of being born on any of the 365 days of the year (sorry, February 29 birthdays ðŸ˜„). Assume that each person is *independent*, so one person's birthday does not have any influence on another person's birthday. 

> What is the probability that two people in the room have the same birthday?

One characteristic of the Birthday Problem that makes it a *classic* is that the result appears counterintuitive at first, but is actually true. While there is technically a different probability for each possible value of *n*, the *truly counterintuitive result* is the following:

- We need at least **23 people in the same room** to have a 50% probability that any two people have the same birthday. 

Let's prove it with a simulation! 

### Single Experiment

First, let's simulate a single room with *n = 23* people, and check whether any two have the same birthday. Because we don't care about the *actual* day/month combination, we can simply select birthdays from the numbers `1:365`:

```{r, prepare-bday}
set.seed(338) # Use for reproducibility!
birthdays = sample(1:365, size = 23, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r, bday-sample, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
set.seed(338) # Use for reproducibility!
birthdays = sample(1:365, size = 23, replace = TRUE)

birthdays
```

- **Note**: Make sure to sample *with replacement* here. Otherwise, we'll never find a birthday match!

### 

Next, we can use two nifty base R functions to detect whether *any* of the elements in the `birthdays` vector are *duplicated*:

- The `duplicated()` function determines which elements of a vector are *duplicates* of other elements. It returns a `TRUE` or `FALSE` for *each* element in the vector.

- The `any()` function determines whether *at least one* element in the vector is `TRUE`. It returns a *single* `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r, dup_bdays, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-bday"}
duplicated(birthdays)
```

```{r, any_dup_bdays, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-bday"}
any(duplicated(birthdays))
```

In my room of 23 people, no one shared a birthday. What about you? (Replace the *338* in `set.seed()` and type the `duplicated()` and `any()` into the first code chunk to see a different result.)

### Many Experiments

Now we'll use `replicate()` to repeat this experiment *many times*. All I need to do is copy/paste the code for the *single* experiment into the body of `replicate()`:

```{r, bday_sim, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-bday"}
bday_match = replicate(10000, {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = 23, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
})

mean(bday_match)
```

In 10,000 simulations, over 50% of the rooms with 23 people had matching birthdays! And because R said it, it must be true...

### Exercise 1

Repeat the Birthday Problem simulation for *n = 50*. 

```{r, ex1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex1-solution}
bday_match = replicate(10000, {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = 50, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
})

mean(bday_match)
```

## Monty Hall Problem

The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), named after the former host of *Let's Make a Deal*, is perhaps one of the most controversial problems in all of probability. 

<center>

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/611e31zP6VZDy/giphy.gif)

</center>

Here's the problem statement, taken from its Wikipedia page:

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Most people will initially claim that there is a 50/50 chance of winning (i.e., a probability of 0.5) if they switch their choice. But it turns out **contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car**!

A key assumption that often flies under the radar is that the host *knows what's behind the doors*.

Let's work through this problem with a simulation!

### Single Experiment

**Step 1: Our initial choice**

The Monty Hall experiment is a bit more involved than the Birthday Problem, and there are several moving pieces. First, we need to select: 

1. The door that contains the car, and 

2. Our initial choice. 

We can simulate this with two calls to `sample()`:

```{r, prepare-mh}
set.seed(228)  # Use for reproducibility!
prize = sample(1:3, size = 1)
choice = sample(1:3, size = 1)
```

```{r, mh, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
set.seed(228)  # Use for reproducibility!
prize = sample(1:3, size = 1)
choice = sample(1:3, size = 1)

prize
choice
```

###

**Step 2: Monty's options**

Next, Monty needs to choose a door. Note that he will only choose a door that satisfies BOTH of the following conditions:

- We did not choose the door first. 

- The door does not contain the car. 

Therefore, Monty's options will consist of the vector `c(1,2,3)`, *minus* our `choice` and the `prize` door:

```{r, mh_monty_options, exercise.setup = "prepare-mh"}
monty_choice_options = c(1,2,3)[-c(prize, choice)]
```
```{r, mh2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-mh"}
monty_choice_options = c(1,2,3)[-c(prize, choice)]
monty_choice_options
```

###

**Step 3: Monty's choice**

Next, we need to determine which door Monty *actually* opens. This comes down to two possibilities:

- If the door we initially chose *contains the car*, then Monty will open *either* one of the remaining doors **at random**.

- If the door we initially chose *does not contain the car*, then Monty only has one option: the remaining door that *does not contain the car*. There is nothing random about his choice in this case!

We can simulate this part with an **if/else statement**, which follows this general format:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ifelse(test, yes, no)
```

- `test` is a **logical** condition

- `yes` is the value if the logical is `TRUE`

- `no` is the value if the logical is `FALSE`

Using the `test` condition of our `choice` door containing the `prize`, it will look something like this:

```{r, mh_monty_choice, exercise.setup = "mh_monty_options"}
set.seed(228)  # Use for reproducibility!
prize = sample(1:3, size = 1)
choice = sample(1:3, size = 1)

monty_choice_options = c(1,2,3)[-c(prize, choice)]

monty_choice = ifelse(choice == prize, 
                      sample(monty_choice_options, size = 1), 
                      monty_choice_options
)
```
```{r, mh3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "mh_monty_choice"}
monty_choice = ifelse(choice == prize, 
                      sample(monty_choice_options, size = 1), 
                      monty_choice_options
)
monty_choice
```

###

**Step 4: Our switching options**

Finally, we need to determine which door we could potentially *switch* to. This will *always* be the door that satisfies BOTH of the following conditions:

- We did not choose the door first. (We can't *switch* to the door we already chose!) 

- Monty didn't open this door in the previous step. 

Similar to Step 2, we have:

```{r, mh_our_switch_options, exercise.setup = "mh_monty_choice"}
set.seed(228)  # Use for reproducibility!
prize = sample(1:3, size = 1)
choice = sample(1:3, size = 1)

monty_choice_options = c(1,2,3)[-c(prize, choice)]

monty_choice = ifelse(choice == prize, 
                      sample(monty_choice_options, size = 1), 
                      monty_choice_options
)

switch_option = c(1,2,3)[-c(choice, monty_choice)]
```
```{r, mh4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "mh_our_switch_options"}
switch_option = c(1,2,3)[-c(choice, monty_choice)]
switch_option
```

###

**Step 5: Does switching win?**

Let's check if the `prize` is in the door given by `switch_option`:

```{r, mh_win, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "mh_our_switch_options"}
prize == switch_option
```

###

**I win!!!**

<center>

</center>

**Try playing with a different seed!**

- Play a new game by using a *different number* from 338 in `set.seed(338)`. Paste the code from each of the previous five steps into the chunk below. Did switching doors win you a car?

```{r sandbox, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```


### Many Experiments

We wrote most of the code for this in the *single experiment*! Some of us won, and some of us lost, depending on the value we entered in `set.seed()`. But it turns out that if we repeated this experiment *over and over*, we'd win 2/3 of the time!

**Let's prove it**:

```{r, mh_sim, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
switch_win = replicate(10000, {
  prize = sample(1:3, size = 1)
  choice = sample(1:3, size = 1)
  
  monty_choice_options = c(1,2,3)[-c(prize, choice)]
  
  monty_choice = ifelse(choice == prize, 
                        sample(monty_choice_options, size = 1), 
                        monty_choice_options)
                      
  switch_option = c(1,2,3)[-c(choice, monty_choice)]
  
  prize == switch_option
})

mean(switch_win)
```

We could also prove this with **Bayes' Rule**, but R is *at least* as much fun. 

### Exercise 2 

Simulate the Monty Hall Problem for *five doors* instead of three. In other words, you choose a door, and Monty opens *three* doors, leaving you left to choose between your initial choice, and one other, unopened door. 

```{r, ex2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex2-solution}
n_doors = 5
switch_win = replicate(10000, {
  prize = sample(1:n_doors, size = 1)
  choice = sample(1:n_doors, size = 1)
  
  monty_choice_options = c(1:n_doors)[-c(prize, choice)]
  
  # No ifelse() needed, as Monty *always* has more than one door to choose from!
  monty_choice = sample(monty_choice_options, size = n_doors - 2)
                      
  switch_option = c(1:n_doors)[-c(choice, monty_choice)]
  
  prize == switch_option
})

mean(switch_win)
```

### Exercise 3**

Now simulate the Monty Hall Problem for *100 doors*!

```{r, ex3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex3-solution}
n_doors = 100
switch_win = replicate(10000, {
  prize = sample(1:n_doors, size = 1)
  choice = sample(1:n_doors, size = 1)
  
  monty_choice_options = c(1:n_doors)[-c(prize, choice)]
  
  # No ifelse() needed, as Monty *always* has more than one door to choose from!
  monty_choice = sample(monty_choice_options, size = n_doors - 2)
                      
  switch_option = c(1:n_doors)[-c(choice, monty_choice)]
  
  prize == switch_option
})

mean(switch_win)
```

## Your Turn!

### Powerball

The [MA Powerball lottery](https://masslottery.com/games/draw-and-instants/powerball/how-to-play) randomly selects five numbers from  1 through 69 and arranges them in order, and one *powerball* number from 1 through 26. If your 6 numbers match the Powerball numbers exactly (including the *powerball* number, which is always listed last), then you win the jackpot. 

<center>

</center>

### Exercise 4 

Estimate the probability that a particular selection of five numbers plus the powerball will win the jackpot.

[*Hint*: Pick any five numbers plus the powerball as "your numbers", and run a simulation to check how many times the Powerball numbers match your own. This probability will be *very* small, as you might expect in a lottery! ðŸ˜…]

```{r, ex4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex4-solution}
my_numbers = 1:6

powerball_win = replicate(10000, {
  first_five = sort(sample(1:69, size = 5, replace = FALSE))
  powerball = sample(1:26, size = 1, replace = FALSE)
  
  sum(c(first_five, powerball) == my_numbers) == 6
})
mean(powerball_win)
```

### Exercise 5

If *any* one of your numbers plus your powerball matches, you win 100 dollars. Find the probability that this outcome occurs. 

```{r, ex5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex5-solution}
my_numbers = 1:6

hundred_win = replicate(10000, {
  first_five = sort(sample(1:69, size = 5, replace = FALSE))
  powerball = sample(1:26, size = 1, replace = FALSE)
  
  (sum(first_five == my_numbers[1:5])) == 1 & (my_numbers[6] == powerball)
})
mean(hundred_win)
```

### Hatcheck Problem

A new restaurant employee checks the hats of 100 people without giving them claim check numbers. When the customers return, the checker returns the hats at random. 

### Exercise 6

What is the probability that nobody get the correct hat back?

```{r, ex6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex6-solution}
wrong_hats = replicate(10000, {
  hats = sample(1:100, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  sum(1:100 == hats) == 0
})
mean(wrong_hats)
```
