## Introduction

When I Google the term "*simulation*", the first result that pops up is the *Oxford Languages* definition:

> simÂ·uÂ·laÂ·tion (noun): Imitation of a situation or process.

There are also articles about [whether we actually live in a simulation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-live-in-a-simulation-chances-are-about-50-50/), video games, and *Matrix-y* images as we scroll further down the list of results. But the *Oxford Languages* definition is enough to work with when studying Probability!

A major goal of probability and statistical inference is to translate data into knowledge and understanding of the real world. And while probabilistic experiments can be *costly*, *tedious*, or downright *impractical* to perform in real life (imagine tossing a coin 1,000 times!), **Monte-Carlo simulations** can help us model these experiments and *imitate* the results that we might expect to see in a real life scenario.

Simulations give us a *ton* of power in a "theoretical" class like *Probability*. If we have a solid understanding of the experimental setting and *how* to actually set up the simulation, we can answer many probability questions that could otherwise be quite challenging to evaluate by hand.

For this lab, we will focus on two core **base R** functions that are used to simulate data:

-   `sample()`: takes a sample of elements from a vector, with or without replacement

-   `replicate()`: repeats an experiment many times, and (usually) returns a vector as the result

We'll also leverage some R tools we've seen already: **vectors**, **indexing**, **logicals**, and more...

Let's get started with some simulations!

## Simple Simulations with `sample()`

The `sample()` function is a simple, yet powerful tool. If we run `?sample`, we can see more information, but it boils down to the following syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
```

-   `x` is the vector of all *objects* from which we are sampling.

-   `size` is the number of objects we would like to select from `x`. If I would like to choose **5** numbers at random, I would enter `size = 5`.

-   `replace` can take one of two values: `TRUE` or `FALSE` - these are case-sensitive, and R handles these two **logical** values rather carefully.

    -   If `replace = TRUE`, we will sample from `x`, `size` times, **with replacement**. In other words, if we select *five numbers* between 1 and 100 *with replacement*, we could potentially choose any of those numbers *more than once*.
    -   If `replace = FALSE`, sampling is performed **without replacement**. This is the **default** setting.

-   `prob` is a *vector* of **probability weights**. This assigns a probability to each element in your vector, `x`.

    -   If we would like to simulate flipping a *biased coin*, the vector `c("H", "T")` might have the probability weights of `prob = c(0.75, 0.25)`. This just means that our biased coin has a 75% probability of landing *Heads*.
    -   `prob = NULL` by **default**, which means it assumes each element from `x` has an equally-likely chance of being sampled.

### 

We can specify the vector `x` in a number of ways. For example...

-   `c("H", "T")` is one way to specify the two possible outcomes from a *single coin flip*.

-   `1:100`, `seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 1)` or `c(1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 99, 100)` are three different ways to specify a vector of the numbers 1 through 100.

    -   I personally prefer `1:100` - if you use `c(...)`, you would actually have to type out *every single number* from 1 through 100. I got lazy and added the `...` instead!

-   There are several ways we could specify a vector of 52 playing cards.

    -   If we don't care about the suit or number, we could just sample from `1:52`, treating each card uniquely.
    -   If we *did* care about the suit of the card, we could type something like:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    c(rep("Hearts", 13), rep("Diamonds", 13), rep("Spades", 13), rep("Clubs", 13))
    ```

> ðŸš¨**NOTE**ðŸš¨: The `sample()` will never return the same output twice, unless you run `set.seed(338)` (or with any other number) just before `sample()`. This will control R's built-in *random number generator*.

### Exercise 1

*As of this writing*, there are **21** people in this class, including Anthony. Let's suppose each person in the class is assigned a different number from 1 through 21. Using `sample()`, randomly select four numbers from this list, **with replacement**.

```{r, ex1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex1-solution}
sample(1:21, size = 4, replace = FALSE)
```

### Exercise 2

Simulate flipping a coin ten times. In this context, why is it essential to sample *with replacement*?

```{r, ex2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex2-solution}
sample(c("H", "T"), size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 3

Suppose we would like to flip a six-sided die, but the sides, *y*, are biased, such that:

| y       | 1    | 2    | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
|:--------|:-----|:-----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| Prob(y) | 0.05 | 0.25 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.4 | 0.1 |

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
data.frame(y = "Prob(y)", one = 0.05, two = 0.25, three = 0.1, four = 0.1, five = 0.4, six = 0.1) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(one = "1", two = "2", three = "3", four = "4", five = "5", six = "6")
```

Simulate rolling this *biased* die 20 times.

```{r, ex3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex3-solution}
sample(1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE, 
       prob = c(0.05, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.1))
```

## Estimating Probabilities

While using `sample()` on its own is nice (I guess?), we haven't actually used it to calculate **probabilities** yet! What we've done so far is use `sample()` to simulate an experiment *once*. But probability (at least when using the [frequentist definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability)) involves repeating a random experiment a large number of times. When we say a fair coin will land "Heads" 50% of the time, we really mean it would land "Heads" 50% of the time **if we tossed the coin over and over again**.

Let's further explore this *not drawn out at all* coin flipping example.

To sample a *single coin toss*, we could use `sample()` as such:

```{r, coin_toss1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
sample(c("H", "T"), size = 1)
```

-   Note that the `replace` option is irrelevant here since we're only flipping the coin once.

Now run that same line *over and over* again. You'll get "H" sometimes, and "T" the other times. You might get three "H" in a row, followed by five "T" in a row. Each toss is equally likely, and *independent* from the previous toss.

### 

To repeat this experiment, say, **10,000 times**, we'll use the `size` option, and save this as `coin_tosses` (because no one wants to see 10,000 values listed out). Don't forget `replace = TRUE` here, since we're repeating this experiment more than once!

```{r, prepare-coins}
set.seed(338) # Keep this!
coin_tosses = sample(c("H", "T"), size = 10000, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r, coins, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
set.seed(338) # Keep this!
coin_tosses = sample(c("H", "T"), size = 10000, replace = TRUE)
```

Next we'll want to check how many elements from the `coin_tosses` vector have the value "H". We can do this by first converting `coin_tosses` to a **logical** vector, and then counting up the number of `TRUE` values:

```{r, coins_sum, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-coins"}
sum(coin_tosses == "H")
```

You could optionally run `coin_tosses == "H"` to see what exactly we are summing up. It's a bunch of `TRUE` and `FALSE` elements, which hold values of **1** and **0** in R, respectively. I simulated 4,960 heads out of 10,000 coin tosses, *but this still isn't a probability*! Remember, a probability is a value between **0 and 1**.

### 

You *could* just divide this by 10,000, but there is an easier way that we'll use a bunch this semester: Simply take the `mean()` of the logical vector of 1s and 0s to get the *proportion* of 1s (i.e., `TRUE` values):

```{r, coins_mean, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-coins"}
mean(coin_tosses == "H")
```

We *know* that the probability is actually **0.50**. But I *estimated* a probability of 0.496. If I simulated even more coin flips, I'd probably get even close to that true probability of 0.50; this fact is summarized in one of the most important theorems in probability theory: [**The Law of Large Numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).

### Exercise 4

Repeat this simulation, but for tossing a fair, six-sided die. Estimate the probability of rolling a **5**. How close is this to the "true" probability?

```{r, ex4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex4-solution}
die_rolls = sample(1:6, size = 10000, replace = TRUE)
mean(die_rolls == 5)
```

## Larger Simulations with `replicate()`

We'll often be faced with more complicated examples that don't necessary involve repeating a *single trial* (i.e., rolling a die *once*) over and over again. The `replicate()` function is an example of an **implicit loop** in R, and it will help us with such calculations.

Here's the setting for this example: Suppose I am working with a standard deck of 52 cards, and I choose two cards at random from the deck. Jacks, queens, and kings each have a value of 10, and aces have a value of 11. Each of the number cards has the value of that number.

> What is the probability that the **sum** of my two cards is exactly 21?

### 

First let's work by simulating this experiment **once**, as we did before. To do this, we need to specify the vector `x`, which is the set of all cards from which we're sampling. But we care about each card's **value** here, *not* the suit. So we can just sample from the following vector twice, *without replacement*:

```{r, prepare-cards}
# Repeat this vector FOUR times, once for each suit
cards = rep(c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11), 4)
```

(**Note**: There isn't actually a "1" card in a standard deck, and we're treating the "Ace" card as having a value of **11** here.)

-   Visit [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) for more about a standard deck of playing cards!

Using the `cards` vector, let's choose two cards, and add up their values:

```{r, cards1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-cards"}
set.seed(338) # Change to your favorite number!
card_draw = sample(cards, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
card_draw

sum(card_draw)

sum(card_draw) == 21
```

The sum of my two cards is **19**, which isn't quite 21... I guess I lost. But if I repeated this *over and over again*, how many times *would* I win?

### 

The `replicate()` function can help us calculate more complicated probabilities, and it takes two values:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
replicate(n, expr)
```

-   `n` is the number of times I want to repeat the single trial. I usually set this to 10,000.

-   `expr` is the *block of code* we wish to repeat `n` times.

For example, these two blocks of code are equivalent:

-   The `sample()` 10,000 times approach:

    ```{r, coins_sample, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
    set.seed(338) # Change to your favorite number!
    coin_tosses = sample(c("H", "T"), size = 20, replace = TRUE)

    mean(coin_tosses == "H")
    ```

-   The `replicate()` 10,000 times approach:

    ```{r, coins_replicate, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
    set.seed(338)
    heads = replicate(20, {
      coin_toss = sample(c("H", "T"), size = 1)
      coin_toss == "H"
    })
    heads
    mean(heads)
    ```

> ðŸš¨**NOTE**ðŸš¨: In `replicate()`, the curly brackets `{ }` are required when you are replicating more than one R expression!

Of course, the `replicate()` approach is more complicated here, but we applied it to a relatively simple calculation! It would make more sense to use the simple approach!

### 

For our *blackjack/21* example, `replicate()` is the way to go. We just want to replicate the following code a bunch of times:

```{r, cards2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-cards"}
card_draw = sample(cards, size = 2, replace = FALSE)

sum(card_draw) == 21
```

The output from `replicate()` will be a vector of 10,000 (or whatever you use for the `n` option) `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. Thus, to find the probability, we simply need to take the `mean()` of this vector.

```{r, cards3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-cards"}
sum_21 = replicate(10000, {
  card_draw = sample(cards, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
  sum(card_draw) == 21
})
mean(sum_21)
```

### The `replicate()` Workflow

In MATH/STAT 338, we'll encounter many probability examples that we can derive *by hand* and/or *estimate through simulation*. Though there will be many cases where the simulation-based approach will provide a simpler and more intuitive way to calculating probabilities.

For the especially complicated simulation-based exercises that you'll encounter, it is a good idea to follow a **workflow**, or a set of steps that you can repeat for similar exercises. For example, I recommend you follow this workflow from [Speegle and Clair (2021)](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/preface.html) when using `replicate()` to estimate probabilities:

1.  Write code that performs the experiment a single time. For example, if we are estimating the **probability of obtaining at least 12 heads in 20 coin tosses**, a single experiment would be *one set of 20 coin tosses*:

    ```{r, coin_toss, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
    coin_tosses = sample(c("H", "T"), size = 20, replace = TRUE)
    sum(coin_tosses == "H") >= 12
    ```

2.  Replicate the experiment a small number of times and **check** the results:

    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    replicate(100, {
      EXPERIMENT GOES HERE
      ...
    })
    ```

3.  Replicate the experiment a large number of times and **store** the results:

    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    event = replicate(10000, {
      EXPERIMENT GOES HERE
      ...
    })
    ```

4.  Estimate the probability with `mean(event)`. Note that `event` will *always* be a **logical vector**, so you'd be taking the mean of a bunch of 1s and 0s.

### Exercise 5

In class we worked through the *Newton-Pepys Problem*. Try to simulate each of the three events using `replcate()`. The problem is stated below.

Isaac Newton was consulted about the following problem by Samuel Pepys, who wanted the information for gambling purposes. Which of the following events has the highest probability?

-   *A*: At least one 6 appears when 6 fair dice are rolled.

-   *B*: At least two 6's appear when 12 fair dice are rolled.

-   *C*: At least three 6's appear when 18 fair dice are rolled.

```{r, ex5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, ex5-solution}
A = replicate(10000, {
  dice_roll = sample(1:6, size = 6, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice_roll == 6) >= 1
})
mean(A)

B = replicate(10000, {
  dice_roll = sample(1:6, size = 12, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice_roll == 6) >= 2
})
mean(B)

C = replicate(10000, {
  dice_roll = sample(1:6, size = 18, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice_roll == 6) >= 3
})
mean(C)
```

## Conclusion

That's it for now! With `sample()` and `replicate()`, you'll have a lot of power to *estimate* sometimes complicated probabilities via **Monte-Carlo simulation**.

We'll cover more probability distributions, calculations, and other techniques throughout the semester, but many of the simulation-based approaches will revolve around these two functions.
